A volume will be in one of the following phases:

Available -- a free resource that is not yet bound to a claim
Bound -- the volume is bound to a claim
Released -- the claim has been deleted, but the resource is not yet reclaimed by the cluster
Failed -- the volume has failed its automatic reclamation
```

What actually gets "mounted" onto the container?

"Two knobs which are particularly important to think about in any deployment are the **binding** and **retention modes**. Weâ€™ll cover these, below."

```
Current reclaim policies are:

Retain -- manual reclamation
Recycle -- basic scrub (rm -rf /thevolume/*)
Delete -- associated storage asset such as AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or OpenStack Cinder volume is deleted
```
