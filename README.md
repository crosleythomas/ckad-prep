## Skills

Doing well on the CKAD exam is as much about having specific skills to demonstrate your knowledge quickly as it is about understanding Kubernetes concepts.  All of these skills need to be performed via `kubectl` as you won't have access to the Kubernetes Dashboard during the exam.
You should be comfortable with the following skills:

- [ ] [Navigating between clusters](skills/ClusterNavigation.md)
- [ ] [Using namespaces](skills/Namespaces.md)
- [ ] [Create and destroy resources](skills/CreateEditDestroy.md)
- [ ] [Inspect and Monitor Resources](skills/InspectMonitor.md)
- [ ] [Quickly find resource fields descriptions](skills/FieldDescriptions.md)
